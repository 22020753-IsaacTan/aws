# DEPRECATED
`asyncCustomerChatUX` approach is no longer supported. Please go with [`startChatContactAPI`](https://github.com/amazon-connect/amazon-connect-chat-ui-examples/blob/master/cloudformationTemplates/startChatContactAPI/README.md) approach. `startChatContactAPI` now support persistent chat feature. With persistent chat, customers can resume previous conversations with the context, metadata, and transcripts carried forward. Customers don't need to repeat themselves when they return to a chat, and agents have access to the entire conversation history.
