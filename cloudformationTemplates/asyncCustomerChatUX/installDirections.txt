Adding this chat widget to your website only takes a few steps:

1. Import amazon-connect-chat-interface.js and amazon-connect-chat-websockets.js. Both of these files were copied into your S3 bucket that hosts the website created by this CloudFormation Template
    <script src="amazon-connect-chat-interface.js"></script>
    <script src="amazon-connect-chat-websocket.js"></script>

2. Initialize the Chat Interface on page load:
    $(document).ready((a) => {
        connect.ChatInterface.init({
            containerId: 'root' // This is the id of the container where you want the widget to reside
        });
    });

3. Start the chat based on a user action. You will want to add fields for the customer name and username because those fields are used in the Lambda function that was created.
    connect.ChatInterface.initiateChat({
        name: customerName,
        username: username,
        region: ${region},
        apiGatewayEndpoint: "https://${apiId}.execute-api.${region}.amazonaws.com/Prod",
        contactAttributes: JSON.stringify({
            "customerName": customerName
        }),
        contactFlowId: "${contactFlowId}",
        instanceId: "${instanceId}"
    }, successHandler, failureHandler)
