# iOS Native Chat Demo üì±
 
An iOS example app for building custom Amazon Connect Chat. This solution implements basic [ChatWidget](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/add-chat-to-website.html) functionality and is capable of Interactive Messages.

> Refer to [#Specifications](#speficications) for details on compatibility, supported versions, and platforms.

## Prerequisites

- Create an Amazon Connect Instance [[guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/amazon-connect-instances.html)]
  - OR: enable chat experience for an existing Connect instance. [[guide](../README.md#enabling-chat-in-an-existing-amazon-connect-contact-center)]

- Create an Amazon Connect Contact Flow, ready to receive chat contacts. [[guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/chat.html)]

    - Note the `instanceId` [[guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/find-instance-arn.html)]
    - Find the `contactFlowId` for the ["Sample Inbound Flow (First Contact)"](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/sample-inbound-flow.html) [[guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/find-contact-flow-id.html)]

- Deploy a custom Amazon Connect Chat backend. [Refer to this backend template](../cloudformationTemplates/startChatContactAPI/README.md)

    - Deploy a StartChatContact template Lambda [[CloudFormation Template](https://github.com/amazon-connect/amazon-connect-chat-ui-examples/tree/master/cloudformationTemplates/startChatContactAPI)]
    - Add the `region`, `API_GATEWAY_ID`, `contactFlowId`, and `instanceId` to `endpoints.js`.


## Local Development

> Versions: Xcode 15, Swift 5
<br> Download Xcode: https://developer.apple.com/xcode/

1. Clone this repository: https://github.com/amazon-connect/amazon-connect-chat-ui-examples/tree/master/
    ```sh
    $ git clone https://github.com/amazon-connect/amazon-connect-chat-ui-examples.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory `iOSChatExample` and make sure that `Podfile` is there, then run `pod install`.
3. Once that is done, You will be able to see a workspace generated `iOSChatExample.xcworkspace`, double click and that will launch the project in Xcode.

4. Edit the Config file with your instance details as generated in [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

    > Make sure you have iOS Simulator added [Adding additional simulators](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safari-developer-tools/adding-additional-simulators)

5. Once everything looks okay, Run the app by clicking on ‚ñ∂Ô∏è button on top left or hit `Cmd + R`.

## How is it working?

### ChatManager
It is responsible for managing the chat state, including initiating the chat, sending and receiving messages, and closing the chat connection when done.

- **Managing Messages**: It holds an array of Message objects, which are published to the UI to reflect real-time chat updates.
- **Handling WebSockets**: ChatManager integrates with WebsocketManager to manage WebSocket connections for real-time message delivery.
- **Interfacing with AWS Services**: Utilizes the AWS Connect Participant Service to register a participant and establish a chat session.

#### Initialization:
Upon instantiation, ChatManager sets up necessary configurations and prepares the AWS Connect Participant client.
- **Chat Initiation**:
When initiateChat is called, it ensures that a WebSocket URL is available, then creates a WebSocket manager instance that listens for incoming messages and events.
- **Message Handling**:
handleIncomingMessage processes incoming messages and updates the UI accordingly. It filters out typing indicators and handles message status updates (e.g., delivered, read).
- **Chat API Calls**:
The manager makes API calls to start chat sessions (startChatContact), create participant connections (createParticipantConnection), and send messages or events (sendChatMessage, sendEvent).

### WebsocketManager:
The WebsocketManager handles the WebSocket connection lifecycle and receives chat messages and other events.

- **WebSocket Connection**:
Manages the WebSocket connection, handling connect and disconnect events, and transmitting chat messages.
- **Receiving Messages**:
Implements the didReceive delegate method to handle different WebSocket events, such as incoming text messages that are then passed to the messageCallback.

- **Connection**:
Connects to the WebSocket using the provided URL and listens for events.
- **Event Handling**:
On receiving events, it delegates processing to the appropriate handlers, for instance:
Messages are processed and passed to ChatManager through the messageCallback.
Connection status changes are logged, and isConnected status is updated.
- **Message Distribution**:
Incoming text messages are deserialized and depending on their type (MESSAGE, EVENT, etc.), appropriate actions are taken, such as updating UI or acknowledging message receipt.

- **websocketDidConnect**: Called when the WebSocket connects, and may subscribe to topics if necessary.
- **websocketDidReceiveMessage**: Parses and handles incoming messages, delegating them back to ChatManager for UI updates.
